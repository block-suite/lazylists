# Lazy Lists

It's not being lazy, it's called being efficient. 

I don't know about you but whenever I end up using the list block it gets long and unwieldy pretty quickly. I was getting tired of it and knew something had to be done. Sure, I found some work arounds but I'm a bit lazy. That word usually has a negative connotation but to me it's just another word for efficient. Work smarter, not harder right? That's what we want to help you with. Getting the most out of the WordPress block editor is our mission in life.
